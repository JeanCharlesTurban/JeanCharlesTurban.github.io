                <p>NOTES: Arguably the strongest person in this bracket, Juan has a surprising amount of speed behind his size and weight, while not the fastest person or agile, his dedication to strength conditioning puts him ahead of the whole pack. It wouldn’t hurt for him to lose a little more weight.</p>

                <p>NOTES: While not the next strongest person in this bracket, he brings elite speed, training, and above par strength to the table causing him to be a force to be reckoned with. His rugby past boosts his stock. Slight cause for concern is the danger or re-injuring his lower body.</p>

                <p>NOTES: Slightly weaker than Naoki, Shadman has sub-par speed, but brings in four years of wrestling experience as well as a certain level of athleticism. This attributes and experiences put him at a significant advantage despite his weight and strength conditioning. Re-injuring his back as well as poor conditioning could drop his stock.</p>

                <p>NOTES: Clearly not the fastest by any measure, Mark brings the explosiveness required to win a quick fight. Combine this with his superior weight and significant strength training you get quite a stock. He however presents a large red flag for major injury in his feet which could be exploited. It would also not hurt to lose some weight in this case.</p>

                <p>NOTES: In prime condition Leul has the potential to be at the top of this bracket in speed, strength and skill, however because of his current conditioning and strength training Leul’s stock drops. Still strong he could drastically improve. He has shown in the past his ability of elite speed but must train to maintain it. Combined with past fighting experience he is a force that will cause most difficulty. Leul also has a high risk for injury for some strange reason, could affect his stock.</p>

                <p>NOTES: Also once a great athlete but after suffering a major injury and the stress of school, Deven’s strength and speed conditioning has been reduced. Yet despite almost 6 months of inactivity Deven remains athletic enough with elite core and leg strength. He however has a weakness in his knee injury which  could drop his stock.</p>

                <p>NOTES: While lightweight and very short in stature, Jean makes up by having a superb muscle weight ratio for his size and weight. Also providing an above average burst of speed he quickly becomes an issue for some. While having no past of injury, he does have the possibility of becoming injured quickly because of his size, weight would definitely improve his stock.</p>

                <p>NOTES: Similar in build to Jean, Nick lacks has a slightly worse strength conditioning but has an arguably better coordination with his hands and a very similar burst of speed. Better and more consistent training could raise his stock. Likewise while no past injury affect him his size does present a possibility of future injury.</p>

                <p>NOTES: One of the tallest in the bracket, Michael suffers from a current foot injury that drops his stock heavily because of his strength mostly coming from his legs. A above average soccer player Michael has the potential to pose a threat through coordinated leg attacks. Some upper-body strength and more aggressive playstyle could improve his stock, let the record show however that based on past events Michael's uppercut is known to be powerful and flawless (circa: Chi Phi 2017)

                <p>NOTES: One of the strongest members of this bracket, George suffers from a lack of top-end speed and coordination. Make no mistake, if well conditioned and with legs trained George poses the possibility of becoming a formidable force. Current wrist injuries do not help his stock.
